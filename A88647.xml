            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have received your Letter, and give you hearty thanks for it: Theſe parts are full of expectation; the great actions in motion have fixed the eyes of the Kingdome, and falſe rumours (the Harbingers of ſuch deſignes) have taken up tranſitory lodgings in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſpoſitions of men; but thoſe which have beene beaten into judgement of the times, ſtand upon their guards, refuſing admittance to what comes not with good authority. That an Army, and a powerfull one is on foot, is knowne; that (if the King bee pattie in it) it will bee irreſiſtable, is likewiſe out
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:160359:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 34 -->of doubt, that the Declarations of it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, and challenges part of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of our Parliament, wee ſee in print; and that the Parliament will part with nothing it can either get or hold, wee know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and (that I abſolutely hope the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of it,) I aſſure you upon my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Now the Army having thus farre diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, and the Parliament not having power to equall what is on foot, the one ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on power and the hearts of the people, the other upon Thornes, and the feſtered wounds of the Common-wealth; I give the one aſſured, the other capable of a very ſpeedy determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I likewiſe judge a Neceſſity of reſtoring the King, and returning the Lawes into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer channell; for ſhould the Army bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with onely their Arreares, and expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Presbyterian partie, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the two Houſes, (when it ſhall bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded) what aſſurance have the Independents in Parliament, that the City (which is Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, and from wherce the Army at this inſtant affirmes would bee raiſed another (to countenance Presbytery) were it not for the Interpoſition of this on Foot) ſhall not raiſe Forces, and deſtroy the Acts of theſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, who forcibly may ſettle themſelves now? That the City ſhall not new-mould the Houſes with Presbyterians, as perhaps the Army may now with Independents? and that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160359:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 34 -->the Houſes then (by vertue of the Citie) ſhall not runne rigorous wayes of Revenge? For what can oppoſe the Citie, if the Armie be away?</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations will not admit me to gleane other Expectations from the Courſes in motion, then Honourable and Popular Concluſions. The King in Parliament, can aſſure the ends of the Armie, can conferre Honours, can gratifie with Eſtates, can make an Act of Oblivion; and then, by the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Parliament, the parties are ſure to enjoy all that is ſo given them: but keepe it ſtill on foot, and disband the Armie, then there is danger of the prevalencie of the other Faction, and conſequently, of the revocation of all Grants to the former. Likewiſe, to keepe an Armie long up, requires a Charge inſupportable, as well as it gives an aſpect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to all who have obſerved the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of theſe Times. Beſides, without the King nothing can be confirmed, nothing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed longer then an Armie is on foot; nor can Peace be ſo ſetled, but that Seedes will be left for a new Warre to ſpring forth, ſo ſoone as the Seaſon can produce it.</p>
            <p>But mee thinkes now there is a Miracle working: An Armie (powerfull to enrich it ſelfe by Offences) is ſo ſpotleſſe, as the world admires it; and this Armie ſummons a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160359:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 35 -->(indeed red as Skarlet) vyes with it in Innocencie, and boldly demands Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Crimes committed againſt the Common-wealth: The nature of the one is (commonly) charged with Sinne and Bloud, and of the other with Pretie, Vertue, and Bleſſings upon the Realme. But as the one hath degenerated into the others qualitie and nature, ſo is it juſt it ſhould receive the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers propertie. As a good Parliament might demand Accompts of a wicked Armie, ſo why may not a righteous Armie demand the like of a wicked Parliament? In mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Juſtice hath layd this Scaene, to be acted in this <hi>Antipodian</hi> Tragedie; and (ſo that it may be the laſt) he little cares how ſoone it be concluded, who is,</p>
